// Welcome to your schema
//   Schema driven development is Keystone's modus operandi
//
// This file is where we define the lists, fields and hooks for our data.
// If you want to learn more about how lists are configured, please read
// - https://keystonejs.com/docs/config/lists

import { list } from "@keystone-6/core";
import { allowAll } from "@keystone-6/core/access";

// see https://keystonejs.com/docs/fields/overview for the full list of fields
//   this is a few common fields for an example
import { text, select } from "@keystone-6/core/fields";

// if you want to make your own fields, see https://keystonejs.com/docs/guides/custom-fields

// when using Typescript, you can refine your types to a stricter subset by importing
// the generated types from '.keystone/types'
import type { Lists } from ".keystone/types";
import { document } from "@keystone-6/fields-document";
